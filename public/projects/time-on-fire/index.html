A simple screen time tracker written in Python for Windows 10.
Why? There are trackers for Windows already.
I didn't find a simple screen time tracker for Windows. A lot of them are for teams/are paid/have a lot of features that I didn't need (like tracking time spent on projects, graphs, analytics, goals, grouping activities and so forth). Most of the time I just needed to check what I was doing today, or to see the average screen time of my apps this week. For these simple tasks, time-on-fire is much better suited, allowing me to do them in a single keystroke: tof report and tof report 2022-07-10:2022-07-16 -m avg respectively. It's deliberately crude and simple, containing only 3 commands (only one of which takes an argument and an option). If you want a GUI and more advanced features, check out ActivityWatch. It's crossplatform, free and open source."><meta name=author content="rednelt"><link rel=canonical href=//localhost:1313/projects/time-on-fire/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.3f10f8ef064bf63e322c1ab5a68acb632d29726d0a44a82946e76c86f9ce92fa.css integrity="sha256-PxD47wZL9j4yLBq1porLYy0pcm0KRKgpRudshvnOkvo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=//localhost:1313/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=//localhost:1313/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=//localhost:1313/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=//localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=//localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=//localhost:1313/projects/time-on-fire/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="//localhost:1313/projects/time-on-fire/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rednelt's portfolio"><meta property="og:title" content="time-on-fire ‚åö"><meta property="og:description" content=" https://github.com/rednelt/time-on-fire

It's deliberately crude and simple, containing only 3 commands (only one of which takes an argument and an option). If you want a GUI and more advanced features, check out ActivityWatch. It's crossplatform, free and open source.\nQuickstart Installation üíæ Execute\npip install time-on-fire in your terminal, and wait till pip finishes the installation. (or py -m pip install tof if didn't work)\nTracking üîé To start tracking your screen time, execute tof track. Your activities (apps, foreground processes to be precise) are now being saved into a database.\nHit Ctrl+C when you're done. Just don't forget to stop recording before you turn off your computer, as the last activity won't be saved!\nYou can add a --debug flag when you execute the track command, to see the transitions between activities (e.g. 1.exe 11:00 -\u003e 2.exe 12:00)\nYou can clear the database with tof clear_db.\nCreating reports üìä Use the report command to create reports of your activities.\nArguments: date_range A date in YYYY-MM-DD format, or a range of dates in YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD format. Default is today.\nOptions: --mode, -m One of the three modes: total, avg and raw.\ntotal - Total screen time per process in range. avg- Average screen time per day per process in range. raw - Raw records (id, date, process name, start time, end time) in range. Default is total.\nExamples: tof report returns a table summarizing your today activity; tof report 2022-05-05:2022-05-18 -m avg returns a table, containing the average screen time of each process per day, from 5th to 18th of May; tof report 2022-04-01 -m raw returns raw database records that were made on 1st of April.\nConfig ‚öôÔ∏è Do you have some app that pops up when idling and messes up your records (a reminder or an alarm, a floating dock, any process that's sometimes or always in the foreground, but you don't want to track its screen time)?\nGood news, you can configure time-on-fire to ignore these processes! How to find the config:\nExecute pip show tof (or py--m pip show tof) and look for a Location row. Go to this path.\nInside site-packages folder (where you just navigated) look for a folder named (or contains) time-on-fire, then navigate inside.\nThere will be a time_on_fire folder (inside of time-on-fire), inside of which you'll find config.py, our configuration file! It looks like this (without comments):\nPOLLING_DELAY = 0.2 IGNORE_PROCESSES = [\"ShellExperienceHost.exe\", \"StartMenuExperienceHost.exe\", \"mbamtray.exe\", \"SearchApp.exe\", \"ueli.exe\", \"explorer.exe\", \"dwm.exe\"] POLLING_DELAY is how fast the script polls for the current foreground process. IGNORE_PROCESSES is a list of processes that the script will ignore.\nNotes If, for example, you switch from Chrome to desktop, it will still count as Chrome's screen time, because explorer.exe does not only pop up at desktop, but also when clicking the taskbar or just idling. I have no reliable way of knowing whether the user switched to desktop or it's popping by itself (it could last from 3 seconds to 15 minutes during testing). Let me know if you have a fix. The inner time_on_fire folder is written with underscores, because it's a package, and Python packages shouldn't have an underscore. The outer folder is a repository (either on GitHub or PyPI). That's it. That's the documentation. It's that simple.\n","wordCount":"651","inLanguage":"en","image":"//localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"rednelt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"//localhost:1313/projects/time-on-fire/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"rednelt's portfolio","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"//localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=//localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="rednelt (Alt + H)"><img src=//localhost:1313/rdnlt_logo_stretch2.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>rednelt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">time-on-fire ‚åö</h1></header><div class=post-content><p><img alt=logo loading=lazy src=/tof.png title=Logo>
